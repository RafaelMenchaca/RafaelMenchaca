## 🔧 Currently Building: Robie Jr.

Robie Jr. is my custom-built robot that evolves each week! It's equipped with:
- Arduino Uno + L293D motor driver
- DC gear motors + ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor for environmental scanning
- OLED display for feedback (replaced LCD)
- Line following with TCRT5000 IR sensors
- Buzzer + LEDs for interaction
- Smart turning logic & idle animations
- Modular and readable C++ code

> 💡 Features: Obstacle avoidance, line following, real-time sensor feedback, and fun personality!
