## 🔧 Currently Building: Robie Jr.

Robie Jr. is my obstacle-avoiding robot powered by:
- Arduino Uno
- L293D motor driver
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo for scanning
- LCD display for feedback
- Buzzer + LEDs for interaction
- Dual 9V battery setup for stable power

> 💡 Features: Smart turning, real-time feedback, personalized behavior, and modular code!
